        "This comprehensive study delves into the performance evaluation of text classification models, specifically focusing on Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The evaluation encompasses diverse datasets, including an original dataset and two derived datasets. Through meticulous analysis, we explore the models' accuracies, precision, and recall across different datasets, shedding light on their strengths, weaknesses, and the impact of feature engineering. This study provides valuable insights into the suitability of models for distinct text classification tasks and emphasizes the importance of aligning model capabilities with dataset characteristics.\""

        "## What Was Done:\n",
        "The function get_pos_verbs_adjectives was created to extract and lemmatize verbs and adjectives from each review in the dataset.\n",
        "This function iterates through each token in a review. If a token is a verb or an adjective, its lemmatized form (base form) is appended to a list.\n",
        "The list of lemmatized verbs and adjectives is then joined into a single string.\n",
        "This process is applied to each review in the dataset, creating derived_dataset1, where each entry consists of the condition (Class) and the concatenated string of lemmatized verbs and adjectives.\n",
        "## Justification:\n",
        "- Verbs: In drug reviews, verbs play a crucial role as they often describe actions or effects related to the medication use (like \"relieve\", \"cause\", \"improve\"). These action words can provide significant insights into the efficacy or side effects of the drugs.\n",
        "- Adjectives: Adjectives in drug reviews are typically used to describe the user's experience or the effects of the drug. Words like \"effective\", \"severe\" (as in side effects), or \"easy\" (as in usability) offer a direct insight into the user's sentiment and the drug's characteristics.\n",
        "- Lemmatization: This process simplifies the text data by converting words into their base form. For example, \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" all become \"run\". This helps in standardizing the data and is beneficial for text-based machine learning models, as it reduces the complexity of the dataset."

        "- Network Depth: Adding more layers to a neural network (making it 'deeper') can enhance its ability to capture complex patterns in the data. However, it also increases the risk of overfitting, especially with smaller datasets.\n",
        "- Neuron Distribution: By using two layers of 50 neurons each, instead of one layer of 100 neurons, the model might develop a more nuanced hierarchical representation of the data. The first layer could capture basic patterns, and the second layer could build on these to capture more complex relationships.\n",

        "**Parameter Chosen:** activation\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Value: The default activation function in scikit-learn's MLP is 'relu' (Rectified Linear Unit).\n",

        "- ReLU vs. Tanh:\n",
        "\n",
        "-- ReLU: It's a linear function that outputs the input directly if positive, otherwise, it will output zero. It's computationally efficient and addresses the vanishing gradient problem to some extent, making it effective for deep networks. However, it's not centered around zero, which can sometimes be a drawback in optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Tanh: This activation function outputs values in a range between -1 and 1, making it zero-centered and potentially leading to better convergence in some cases. However, it can suffer from vanishing gradients in deep networks.\n",
        "- Choice of Tanh: The 'tanh' function can sometimes provide better performance for certain datasets, especially where the normalization of feature scales is beneficial. The zero-centered nature of 'tanh' can lead to more efficient training in some cases."

        "## Overall Trends\n",
        "\n",
        "- Accuracy: The Logistic Regression model consistently shows high accuracy across all datasets, with its best performance on the original dataset. The original MLP model also performs well, particularly on the original dataset. Both MLP Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 show a drop in accuracy compared to the original MLP, especially on the derived datasets.\n",
        "- Precision and Recall: The MLP models (original and experiments) tend to have very high precision and recall scores, often nearing 1 (or 100%). This is particularly notable on the original dataset. However, these scores decrease in the derived datasets, especially in Experiment 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model-Specific Observations\n",
        "- Logistic Regression:\n",
        "Shows robust performance across all datasets.\n",
        "It maintains good balance between precision and recall, indicating effective classification with a balanced approach to false positives and false negatives.\n",
        "- Original MLP:\n",
        "Achieves exceptionally high precision and recall on the original dataset, suggesting it's very effective in this context.\n",
        "Performance slightly decreases on the derived datasets but still remains strong.\n",
        "- MLP Experiment 1 (Modified Hidden Layers):\n",
        "Slightly lower accuracy compared to the original MLP.\n",
        "Very high precision and recall on the original dataset, but there is a notable drop on the derived datasets.\n",
        "### - MLP Experiment 2 (Modified Activation Function):\n",
        "Shows a decrease in accuracy, precision, and recall across all datasets compared to the original MLP model. This suggests that the 'tanh' activation function may not be as effective for this particular task as the default 'relu'.\n",
        "This model seems more sensitive to the changes in the datasets.\n",
        "### Dataset-Specific Observations\n",
        "- Original Dataset:\n",
        "All models perform best on this dataset. This suggests that the original dataset's features are well-suited for these models, especially for the MLP-based models.\n",
        "- Derived Dataset 1:\n",
        "A noticeable drop in model performance, particularly for the MLP models. This may indicate that the feature transformation (focusing on verbs and adjectives) in this dataset does not align as well with the models’ strengths.\n",
        "- Derived Dataset 2:\n",
        "Similar to Derived Dataset 1, there's a decrease in performance for all models. This implies that the inclusion of named entities and adjectives might not provide as rich or informative features for these models as the original dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "The Logistic Regression model shows strong and consistent performance across all datasets, making it a reliable choice for this classification task.\n",
        "The original MLP model is highly effective on the original dataset but less so on the derived datasets. The modifications in the MLP experiments did not consistently improve performance, indicating that the default parameters of the MLP are already quite optimized for this task.\n",
        "The decrease in performance on the derived datasets suggests that the feature engineering in these datasets may not be as effective for these models as the original dataset's features."
